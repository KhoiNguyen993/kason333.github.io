        <h3>Survey Results</h3>
        <p>
          During my research phase with two other designers we did in-person
          interviews, survey, and eventually we got a hold of the stakeholder.
          Base on the survey, our participants are mostly mid career working
          professional and they don't have a lot of time for volunteer but they
          do have a lot of resources to donate. After collecting the results, we
          analyzed the data using multiple techniques.
        </p>

        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        <p>
          From our in-person interview results. We analyzed the answers and
          information from our participants and created a affinity diagram
          (below). The affinity diagram shed keys insights into our research
          findings and allowed us to easily extract valuable information.

        </div>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>
          The affinity diagram illustrated above helped create the user persona
          (below) for this project. The user persona was a helpful tools
          throughout the design process and bridge the gap between research and
          planning. In this project we focused on Susan, a college student.

        <h3>Susan's Journey Map</h3>
        <p>
          The user journey displays a typical process that involves scheduling a
          pet therapy event for Susan's school. We created the map to empathize
          with Susan and to showcase Susan's emotions, thoughts and actions
          during her scheduling process. We ultimately extracted key points,
          Susan's needs and pain points.

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          While we were working on our analysis, we thought that "Pet Partners"
          were going to be our main competitor but when we talked to the
          stakeholder turned out they are partners and every action is through
          "Pet Partners". People contact "Pet Partners" and they transfer them
          to "Paws 4 Healing" based on their location. "Love 4 Paws" and "UCI
          Health" are our competitors, specify in having people volunteer to be
          handlers and bringing their animals but not so much for scheduling a
          therapy.

        <h3>SWOT</h3>
        <p>
          This SWOT analysis (below) on original website we found that they did
          have their own contents they were very explicit about becoming a pet
          handlers and the things that they do. Even with the outdated look
          their navigation structure was decent and everything was layout
          simple.

        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <p>
          Below is the style guide that I created. The colors look more vibrant,
          fun and happy. We are using SF Pro Display and Roboto for typography
          to make the website looks more clean and modern. I also created button
          interactions to let user know when the button is disabled and when is
          active.

        <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
        <p>
          During my logo redesign process, I broke down the meaning of their
          brand. The reason why I chose pink over their yellow is because they
          have a very tight relationship with "Pet Partners" so I designed "Paws
          4 Healing" looks relative with their partner and then I started to add
          more illustrations to make the logo has more meaning.

        <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Through out research and sketching, I landed at the first low fidelity
          wireframes. The task for this wireframe is schedule a pet therapy
          event at a school. Based on desired event location and time, Susan can
          easily schedule her event at her school through simple and straight
          forward scheduling process.

        <h3>Main Takeaways From Testing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow users to mark their favorite animals</li>
          <li>Design a pending landing page so users can bookmark</li>
          <li>Pop-up warning when go back while filling forms</li>
          <li>Stay with color palette</li>
          <li>Footer needs improve</li>
          <li>Take out the shadow behind logo since the website is flat</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Design micro-interactions</li>
          <li>
            Create a search tool that users can search their favorite animals
            based on zip code
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a tracking page that shows the status of the scheduling
            request
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I had an amazing time working on this project. I experienced branding
          design, responsive design, and sketch illustrations. I thoroughly
          enjoyed the research and interview process. At this point, I am eager
          to jump into my next project. I delivered a consistent, clean, modern
          look product that solves a real problem for Susan and everyone
          struggling with the original website.
